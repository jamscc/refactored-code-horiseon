# Horiseon Webpage (Refactored Code)

## Description

Users can access this webpage to find information about the social solution services of Horiseon. Users can also access the underlying codebase (see Links and Usage below), which was structured to follow various accessibility standards. For example, it includes various semantic elements in a particular order (e.g., header, nav, main, section, figure, figcaption, and footer) to help users understand the flow and structure of the page. Also, the sequential flow can be understood via the headings, and alt attributes are included in the img elements.
